  + You can search specific tags by specifying ?tags= in the URL e.g. /?tags=wolf&page=1&limit=10 /?tags=wolf+rating:s&page=1&limit=10 
  + You can skip to a specific page specifying ?page= in the URL e.g. /?tags=wolf&page=1&limit=10

* Number of items loaded per Ajax request can be changed for optimal performance on all internet connections.
* Ability to switch between NSFW and SFW content at a click of a button. (This relies on the images being tagged correctly on E621.net)
* You can save the html file locally and use it, just make sure you add a separator e.g. the question mark in file://path/to/e621p/index.html?tags=fox so the browser knows to pick up the right file and get the correct tags.
